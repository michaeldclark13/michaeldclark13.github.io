        <h1>CSE 5544: Traumatic Brain Injury Visualizations</h1>
        <h5>Michael Clark (clark.2816)</h5>

        <h3>Report</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Description: The following visualizations display interesting information 
                on Traumatic Brain Injury Patients. The first visualization shows the differences
                between the number of males and females encountered over the roughly 5000 day study. 
                The second visualization highlights some symptoms patients were reported exhibiting
                over time based on their age group.
            </li>
            <li>Decisions: I chose the health dataset since I wanted to gain experience importing 
                and modifing excel (and csv) data. The tools (D3 and Tableau Public) were chosen based
                on an in-class demo (D3) and reported ease of use (Tableau) 
            </li>
            <li>Steps: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        D3: I converted the excel file into CSV data. I then imported the data and modified
                        it using javascript to obtain the data I wanted. From here I used the D3 API and some
                        Javascript logic to create two bar graphs which can be toggled by the button below the 
                        graph.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tableau Public: I imported the excel file into the Tableau desktop application. I then used 
                        the interface to generate the line graphs. From here I published the visualization and embeded
                        the visualization in this html page.

            </li>
            <li<>
                Image Preference: I prefer the Tableau visualization because of its color coding and legend. 
                I feel like it is easier to read as well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pros and Cons: See below descriptions
            </li>
            <li>
                Extra: For the D3 visualization, a button at the bottom is used to toggle male and female data.
            </li>
          </ul>  

        <!-- D3 Visualizations-->
        <h3>D3 Visualization </h3>
        <p>
           For my first visualization, I used the data-driven document tool 
           (D3) to display the the number of male and female patients that were
           were studied over the roughly 5000 day study. The X-axis for each graph
           represents the number of days before or after the 1st TBI. 
        </p>

        <p>
            D3 is an incredibly verstile tool since it harnesses the power of Javascript
            code from which an almost limitless amount of visualizations can be generated. 
            D3 can draw lines, points, rectangles (bar graphs), and circles using svg, and 
            there are many APIs available to render more advanced visualization techniques.
            All data types also are supported. The one major downside to D3 is the amount of
            time and knowledge that must first be invested before any meaningful visualizations
            can be rendered. A strong knowledge of Javascript is also necessary to refine the data
            prior to visualization. The convention of stringing together many .function() statements
            is also a confusing and frankly poorly designed framework for readable code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would only use D3 as a visualization tool if my data required an high level of customization
            and control. Using D3, arrays of data can be parsed via Javascript and then used to draw a variety
            of shapes and diagrams, all without having to modify a CSV file beforehand. 
        </p>

        <p>
            NOTE: If the visualization does not render, please REFRESH the page as an error in the order of 
            CSV documents loaded has likely occured.
        </p>
        <p>
            2nd NOTE: The gender which is currently displayed can be changed by pressing the button below 
            the visualization.
        </p>
        <svg id = "MaleFrequency" height="525" width="1000"></svg>
        <button onclick="switchGenders()">Change Gender Displayed</button>

        <!-- Tableau Visualization-->
        <h3>Tableau Visualization </h3>
        <p>
           For my second visualization, I used the Tableau Public tool 
           to display the occurrance of a variety of symptoms (PTSD, 
           Sleep Difficulties, Alzheimers, Depression, Endocrine Issues, and Stress)
           over the 9 year study across the different age groups. Overall, a high number
           of depression cases were reported for ages 18-34 and a high number of sleep
           and PTSD disorders were reported for ages 25-34.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tableau public is quite an easy tool to use because of its powerful and yet simple
            user interface. The tool allows for quick import of excel data from which data 
            can be modified and finally accepted. These columns are broken into different 
            dimensions that can be used in a variety of ways to create bar graphs, scatterplots,
            line graphs, and more advanced visualizations. Because of its ease of use, a high number
            of visualizations can be rendered from one or more data sets at a time. Once the user
            is happy with the data sets, he or she can publish her visualizations online and then embed
            the interactive visualization into an html page (as seen below). Most of the common data types
            are supported by tableau, while volume rendering is not a supported feature of the interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would use Tableau public in the future because of its ease of use and its powerfulful interface. 
            The one downside of this tool in comparison to D3 would be its lack of programmability. Code offers
            an almost endless number of possibilities in terms of manipulation and visualization of data. Regardless
            of the features offered by the Tableau interface, if a data set required a high level of customability, a 
            different visualization tool should be utilized.
